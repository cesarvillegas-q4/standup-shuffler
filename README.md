# Standup shuffler
A small name shuffler that will show a joke before showing our names for standup.
The jokes are being called from the dadjokes.io API, the shuffler can make 50 requests per day, so if it doesnÂ´t load the joke it means a lot of people have been checking out the shuffler :v

Hopefully this will not get me fired.
